# EnviSave
## Inspiration
As our world facing currently facing a lot of environmental concerns.Humans impact the physical environment in many ways:  pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation,plastic waste  . Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water.
So we proposed a idea to control this as theme represents social upliftment.

## What it does
Web app:-This website takes data from user to report environmental issue in their local area and informs organizations to spread awareness and motivate young minds to contribute towards our nature in positive way.

## How we built it
We used figma to make a prototype for our idea as a contribution towards environment .Tech stack can be used Html,CSS,javascript,PHP ,SQL ,bootstrap.

## Challenges we ran into
Initial approach on how to implement our idea,design challenges ,function addition

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a prototype that (sort of) works, and using multiple languages and databases to empower and help those with accessibility issues.

## What we learned
Various design implementations,teamwork ,making prototypes

## What's next for ENVI SAVE
